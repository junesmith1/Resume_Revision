      <p>
        This project simulates a real-world train switch yard using multi-threaded programming in Java. Each train is modeled as an independent thread that must acquire exclusive access to a specific sequence of switches before moving through the yard. To prevent deadlock, trains must acquire switches in a fixed order and release all locks if any required switch is unavailable.     The simulation reads its configuration from CSV files that define the train fleet and the valid switch-yard paths. Java’s ExecutorService is used to manage concurrent train threads, and ReentrantLock objects control access to shared switch resources. The program outputs detailed status messages showing lock acquisition, waiting behavior, train dispatching, and final system state.
